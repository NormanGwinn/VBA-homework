# Explanation of Norman's VBA Homework

I like to separate data files from business logic files.  I wrote "StockAnalyzer.xslm" as the business logic workbook.  It has a user interface that allows the user to select a file of stock data for analysis.

When the user clicks the Analyze button, the reports for each sheet of stock data are dynamically added to the StockAnalyzer workbook.

### Stock Analysis for 2014
